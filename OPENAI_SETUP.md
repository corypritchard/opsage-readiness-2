# OpenAI Agent Setup Guide

## Overview
The FMECA AI Agent is now fully integrated into the **Opsage Assistant** panel on the right side of your screen! This upgrade transforms the simple edit mode into a powerful AI agent that can perform complex FMECA data operations using natural language.

## ‚úÖ Setup Complete!

Your OpenAI AI Agent is now fully integrated and working with your existing Supabase OpenAI function. No additional setup is required!

## How It Works

The AI Agent uses your existing Supabase Edge Function (`chat-with-ai`) which already has access to your OpenAI API key. The architecture is:

```
User Request ‚Üí Opsage Assistant ‚Üí Supabase Edge Function ‚Üí OpenAI API ‚Üí Response
```

This approach is:
- **Secure**: API key stays on the server
- **Efficient**: Uses your existing optimized function
- **Reliable**: Leverages proven Supabase infrastructure
- **Integrated**: Works seamlessly with your existing UI

## Getting Started

1. **Navigate to FMECA Page**: Go to your FMECA analysis page
2. **Look at the Right Panel**: The Opsage Assistant is always visible on the right
3. **Switch to Edit Mode**: Click the "Edit" button in the mode toggle (green button)
4. **Start Chatting**: Type your first command or use a quick command button
5. **Watch the Magic**: See the AI think through and execute your requests with verbose feedback

### Quick Start Commands
Try these example commands to get started:
- Click any of the quick command buttons in the assistant
- "Show me all high-risk items with severity level 4 or 5"
- "Add a new pump failure analysis for centrifugal pump bearing failure"
- "Analyze the data for completeness issues"

## Technical Details

### Integration Points
- **Frontend**: Enhanced `AIChatPanel` component (the Opsage Assistant)
- **Service Layer**: `FMECAAgent` class handles communication
- **Backend**: Existing Supabase Edge Function (`chat-with-ai`)
- **Database**: Automatic persistence to your FMECA tables

### Data Flow
1. User types natural language request in Opsage Assistant
2. Agent processes request and shows thinking process (ü§î)
3. Request sent to Supabase Edge Function
4. OpenAI processes with function calling context
5. Response includes data modifications if needed
6. Changes automatically saved to database
7. UI updates with verbose feedback and function visualizations

### Modes
- **Edit Mode** (Green): Full AI agent with data modification capabilities
- **Ask Mode** (Orange): Questions and analysis only, no data changes

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check Supabase Function**: Ensure your `chat-with-ai` function is deployed
2. **Verify OpenAI Key**: Confirm your OpenAI API key is set in Supabase secrets
3. **Database Permissions**: Ensure RLS policies allow data access
4. **Browser Console**: Check for any error messages
5. **Mode Check**: Make sure you're in "Edit" mode for data modifications

## Support

The AI Agent is designed to be conversational and helpful. If you're unsure about a command:
- Ask the AI: "What can you help me with?"
- Use the quick command buttons for examples
- Try natural language - the AI is very flexible!
- Switch to "Ask" mode for questions without data changes

## What's New

### Upgraded from Simple Edit Mode
The Opsage Assistant has been transformed from a simple edit interface to a full AI agent:

**Before**: Basic text input with simple AI responses
**Now**: Full conversational AI with:
- Verbose thinking process display
- Function call execution and visualization  
- Complex data operations
- Natural language understanding
- Step-by-step operation feedback
